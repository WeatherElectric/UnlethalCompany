# UnlethalCompany

Removes all enemies from the game.

Useful for practicing routes, or if you just want to explore the area without getting murdered by those DAMN FACEBUGS.

If you want to use this in multiplayer, EVERYONE needs to have this mod installed.

## Known Issues

* Turrets do not fully get removed. Their AI is removed, they will not shoot at you, but they are still visible. I don't consider it too big of a problem, they won't shoot you.
* This might happen with landmines too, but they will not explode.
